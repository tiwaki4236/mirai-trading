### What it does
  The aim of our project is to utilize the advantages of Sui-Move, namely high throughput transactions and object-centric shared objects, to provide a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for goods and digital assets. Our platform will incorporate auction and futures trading functionalities, creating a space where participants can trade a wide variety of goods and assets.

### The problem it solves
  The introduction of auction and futures trading capabilities represents a significant innovation. This project could provide the opportunity to trade goods that have previously been withdrawn from futures trading (e.g., rice futures) as well as assets that traditionally have not had futures functionalities within auctions.

### Challenges I ran into
  Testing on DevNet has not yet been completed. While we have been able to learn a lot about Sui-Move, there are still aspects we are yet to fully grasp. For instance, running tests in the Sui-Dev Net environment, managing Object IDs, and understanding the cost implications of transaction fees and gas prices associated with Shared Objects.
 One significant challenge during development was considering whether it would be possible to implement a feature to present users with future prices inclusive of gas fees. After much deliberation, considering the markedly lower gas fees associated with SUI compared to other chains, the decision was made to initially design the platform without considering gas fees in the price settings.

### Technologies I used & How we built it
  We have created prototypes and developed source code for features using the SUI-MOVE language. This includes functionalities such as futures trading, escrow services, and auction capabilities based on the modifications of Mysten Labs Sui Programmability sample codes.
### What we learned
  We have come to understand that Sui-Move is a high-potential language through needing to review source code examples from Mysten Labs and Sui developer communities. The language's ability to facilitate high-throughput transactions, manage shared object states, as well as to append and remove additional information, indicates its significant potential and robust capabilities.

### What's next for
   We believe that Mirai Trading will revolutionize the trading of goods and digital assets, bringing unprecedented accessibility and flexibility to the marketplace. Your support and feedback are crucial in helping us to realize this vision.

We would greatly appreciate constructive comments and advice from the developer community to help us move forward.
